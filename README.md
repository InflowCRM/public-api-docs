# Welcome to the InflowCRM API Documentation

Welcome to the official API documentation for InflowCRM. Here you will find all the information you need to integrate with our services.

We offer two types of APIs to meet the diverse needs of developers:

- **[REST API](docs/rest-api/README.md)**: A classic and simple-to-use API, ideal for most applications.
- **[GraphQL API](docs/graphql/README.md)**: A flexible and efficient API that allows for precise data queries.

Choose the API that best suits your project and start building!
