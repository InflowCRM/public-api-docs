# Welcome to the InflowCRM API Documentation

Welcome to the official API documentation for InflowCRM. Here you will find all the information you need to integrate with our services.

**[Online Documentation](https://inflowcrm.github.io/public-api-docs/)**

We offer two types of APIs to meet the diverse needs of developers:

- **[REST API](docs/rest-api/README.md)**: A classic and simple-to-use API, ideal for most applications.
- **[GraphQL API](docs/graphql/README.md)**: A flexible and efficient API that allows for precise data queries.
- **[n8n Community Node](docs/n8n-node.md)**: Integrate Inflow CRM with n8n workflows using the official community node.

Choose the API that best suits your project and start building!
